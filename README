Uematsu is a replacement for SpoonyBard, which is a program used to control 
music played within Final Fantasy XI when combined with the MusicMod plugin 
for Ashita or the Vanatunes plugin for Windower. 

It allows you to set simple rules via the GUI interface, as well as some 
more complex and sophisticated rules by editing the profiles it produces.
Profiles are saved as Lua scripts, and can use any of the facilities 
available from the Lua core as well as several conditions from within 
FFXI in order to define what tracks should play and when.

Software is currently pre-alpha, but the background processing works and 
you can currently script behavior manually. Several TODOs can be found in 
the code where work needs to be done, and the GUI layout can give you an 
idea of how the program is intended to work.
